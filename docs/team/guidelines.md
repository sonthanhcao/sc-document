### Code Standards

#### General Principles

- **Maintainability**: Design for long-term maintenance and evolution
- **Testability**: Write code that can be easily tested
- **Documentation**: Document your code and decisions
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions

#### Code Style

```python
# Good: Clear, descriptive variable names
user_count = len(active_users)
total_revenue = calculate_monthly_revenue()

# Bad: Unclear abbreviations
uc = len(au)
tr = calc_mr()

# Good: Descriptive function names
def calculate_user_statistics(user_data):
    """Calculate comprehensive user statistics."""
    pass

# Bad: Vague function names
def calc(data):
    pass
```

#### Documentation Standards

```python
def process_user_data(user_id: int, include_history: bool = True) -> dict:
    """
    Process user data and return comprehensive user information.
    
    Args:
        user_id: The unique identifier of the user
        include_history: Whether to include user history in the response
        
    Returns:
        dict: User data with the following structure:
            {
                'id': int,
                'name': str,
                'email': str,
                'history': list (optional)
            }
            
    Raises:
        UserNotFoundError: If the user_id doesn't exist
        ValidationError: If the user_id is invalid
        
    Example:
        >>> user_data = process_user_data(123, include_history=True)
        >>> print(user_data['name'])
        'John Doe'
    """
    pass
```
